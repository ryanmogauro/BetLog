# BetLog

This is a small program I wrote to track my occasional sports bet. Included in it is a dictionary to store bets (and their corresponding winnings), as well as functions to calculate things like your net profit, biggest win, etc. It's not much, but some people may find it useful. At the bottom of the file, I included my personal bet log to demostrate how I use it.
